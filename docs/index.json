	"content": "The Lumina® desktop is designed to be fast, customizable, flexible, and lightweight. Lumina® works great in multi-monitor configurations and with high-resolution monitors (4K+) as well as single-screen configurations on laptops or tablets. Lumina is designed to work out-of-box without end user apps, and requires fewer dependencies than most other desktop environments. The Lumina® desktop does not require PolicyKit, HAL or systemd. This makes Lumina® very portable and the desktop can be run on most flavors of BSD and GNU/Linux.\nDesktop Features Quick and Easy to Configure Quickly and easily change your display and theming settings using the Lumina® configuration utility (lumina-config on the command-line). It is also a fully-featured desktop configuration where nearly every single item on the desktop can be changed or customized as desired.\n All desktop configuration files are simple plain-text files on the back-end. Desktop will dynamically detect configuration changes to adjust as needed. Appearance profiles can easily be used to reproduce the look and feel of other common desktop systems. Custom appearance profiles can also be created/used. The entire desktop appearance is governed by a simple plugin system  Show desktop icons for files in the \u0026ldquo;Desktop\u0026rdquo; directory, or hide everything for a more minimalistic look. Add desktop widgets to the screen  Application launcher icons Audio file player Calendar Notepad RSS/Atom Feed Reader System statistics monitor (CPU, memory, temperatures) Desktop Links for removable media (if supported by your OS).   Customize the right-click desktop context menu  Shortcuts to any/all applications Launch basic apps (default terminal or file manager) Provide a task manager for the true desktop-minimalists Provide a way to run user-created \u0026ldquo;menu scripts\u0026rdquo; to dynamically generate new types of context menu items.      Fast and Responsive Lumina® is extremely minimal and can be used on systems with as little as 1GB of memory. It is very self-contained and does not require any particular utilities or libraries aside from very small handful. Lumina is designed around the concept of complete modularity. Your applications are completely independant from the desktop itself and can be added/removed at will without loss of functionality.\nOptional Stand-Alone Utilities There are many utilities that are developed alongside the Lumina desktop to ensure that a full-range of functionality is available if nothing other than the Lumina desktop and utilities are installed. Each of these utilities is available independently of the desktop and can be built or used as a separate stand-alone utility on other desktops or operating systems as desired. These utilities may have special integration options when used in conjunction with the Lumina desktop however.\nInsight File Manager Browse the local filesystem and manage files and directories with the Insight File Manager (lumina-fm on the command line).\n Browse files/directories. Multiple tab support as well as support for two side-by-side directories per tab. Provide instant viewing/rollback of files or directories that are available in ZFS snapshots. Provide support for custom bookmarks. Provides basic interactions with Git to clone a repository or view the status of a local repo. Multiple viewing and sorting options Built-in slideshow viewer for image files with very basic image editing functionality (rotation, zoom in/out) Built-in multimedia viewer for basic playback of local files.  File Archiver Extract or compress files with the Lumina Archiver (lumina-archiver on the command line).\n Compatible with many archive file formats. Easy to use and understand. Create/modify archives, or extract/view individual items from within an archive. Able to burn ISO and IMG boot images to a USB device. Integrated into the Insight file manager menu options for quick access.  Scientific Calculator Simple and Scientific calculation provided with Lumina Calculator (lumina-calculator on the command line).\n Works with a keyboard numpad. Calculator history can be saved as a text document. Advanced scientific calculation is included.  Text Editor Simple text editing provided by Lumina Text Editor (lumina-textedit or lte on the command line).\n Plaintext editor supporting variable fonts and font sizes. Customizable display supports showing line numbers, syntax highlighting, and dynamic word wrapping. Editor autodetects the text file type and applies appropriate syntax highlighting. The user can modify highlighting rules in real time.  Multimedia Playback and Pandora Radio Streaming Local file playlist and Pandora radio streaming provided by the Lumina Media Player (lumina-mediaplayer on the command line).\n Create playlists of local multimedia files (audio and video) Stream music from the Pandora radio streaming service (USA only) Minimizes into the system tray for no-interruption background music.  Create/Edit Screenshots Take screenshots of individual applications, individual screens, or the entire desktop session with the \u0026ldquo;print screen\u0026rdquo; keyboard shortcut (or run lumina-screenshot on the command line).\n Easily take screenshots of anything you need (including user-defined screen regions). Option for including or excluding window borders for single-window screenshots Supports time-delayed screenshots. Crop screenshots directly in the viewer before saving them to a file Copy screenshots directly onto the system clipboard for pasting into other applications (without needing to save a file first). Instant-edit launcher for quickly saving a file and opening the system-default image editor for advanced interactions.  PDF File Viewer View PDF files and use them to give presentations easily with the Lumina PDF Viewer (lumina-pdf on the command line).\n View/Print PDF files. Also includes support for some PDF annotations such as table of contents, hyperlinks, and more! Multiple viewing options, such as full-width, full-page, two-column, and grid mode! Presentation mode with multi-monitor awareness. Also includes a presentation timer on the main screen for making sure you don\u0026rsquo;t run over time!  Multi-Monitor Management Supports configuring multi-monitor displays via the xrandr protocols (lumina-xconfig on the command line).\n Add and remove screens Save a customized screen layout as your user default. Dynamically adjust the physical position or size of each screen. Configure resolution and rotation for each screen. Create custom screen profiles and quickly load them as needed.  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "How is it different from other desktop environments?  Designed to work best with TrueOS® and Project Trident®, but specifically works very well for the BSD community at large. Lumina® can also be easily ported to any OS, including Linux distros). Does not require any of the commonly-used desktop implementation frameworks (DBUS, policykit, consolekit, systemd, HALD, etc..). Does not come bundled with any “end-user” applications (web browsers, email clients, multimedia software, office suites, etc..). The only utilities that Lumina brings to the table by default are the ones written specifically for the project and are generally for background/utilitarian functionality (the largest utility is the file manager). Simple text-based configuration file for setting system-wide defaults for new users. This allows distributors of the desktop to easily pre-set the system defaults/interface so it just works for the end user. Plugin-based interface design. This allows the user to make the desktop as light/heavy as desired (within reason) simply by choosing which plugins to have running on their desktop/panels. Designed to function as a general-purpose system interface – easily pre-configured to run on any type/size of device or screen. See the features page for additional details.  What operating systems is it available for? Lumina is highly portable and should work on any Unix-like operating system, with a single OS-compatibility class for porters to check/update as necessary. It has already been ported to all the various BSD operating systems, as well as many of the Linux distributions.\nWhat graphical systems is it available for? Lumina is currently only available on the X11 graphical system. The code-base is designed to be easily ported to another graphical system sometime down the road (only a single file to re-implement in the new system), but at the present moment, there is no scheduled time for any conversions to take place.\nWhat does it look like?  Due to the flexibility of Lumina®’s plugin-based framework, the interface can take almost any appearance that you want (including copying other common desktop interfaces). Please view our “Screenshots” page for some examples. Note that as we continue to create more plugins with every new version of Lumina®, the variability of the interface just continues to grow. If you have a particular plugin/feature that you would like to see, please post a feature request!  How can I get involved? View the Community Page for inspiration on how to get started!\n"

	"description": "The past and future of the Lumina desktop",
	"content": "History \u0026ldquo;Study the past if you would define the future.\u0026rdquo; ~Confucius\nBefore we discuss the Lumina Desktop today, lets first go back and discuss the past. The Lumina Desktop was started in 2012 by Ken Moore. He started working on it in his free time. He wanted to design a small lightweight desktop for PC-BSD that didn\u0026rsquo;t come with the challenge of dealing with Linux-isms. However instead of designing a desktop that had BSD-isms, he decided to design the desktop to be as OS agnostic as possible with as few dependecies as possible. In time, Lumina became the default desktop for PC-BSD. In early 2014 the Lumina code from the PC-BSD git repo was moved to Github.\nI met Ken for the first time in the summer of 2014 at Southeast Linuxfest. Myself and Noah Cheliah had gone to SELF to cover the conference for the LinuxActionShow which I was the producer of at the time. I chatted with Ken for about 10 minutes about a variety of things and when he learned that I was a Puppylinux developer and that I liked small effecient and minimal systems he asked what Desktop I used. While explaining the whys behind my use of Openbox he had this almost Schoolgirl-esque smirk on his face, so after a few minutes I stopped and asked him what was so funny. He chuckled and then let me know that he was writing a small minimal desktop, and proceded to show me his laptop where he had a very early version of it running. I asked him what version it was and he remarked that there weren\u0026rsquo;t even version numbers yet, and I replied, \u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026hellip; so like 0.4?\u0026rdquo; to which he laughed and said \u0026ldquo;Sure.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter getting home from SELF and getting settled back into my schedule I eventually got it compiling and running on my Slackware box. From that point on I helped Ken with fuzzing the desktop and reporting bugs. The Majority of the issues turned out to be really weird ones due to the differences between Qt on Linux and FreeBSD. I think the most hiliarious one was being able to crash the file manager, by opening it up and hitting Down-Down-Enter. I could reproduce it like clockwork on Linux, Ken was unable to on FreeBSD. Eventually the necessity of being able to reproduce each others bugs caused me to get involved with the PC-BSD project. I worked with that project up through its name change into TrueOS, and then the later sunsetting of the TrueOS Desktop. At this point Ken and I created Project Trident to give the current TrueOS Desktop users somewhere to land. The work continued on Project Trident up through 2019 and its transition to Linux as its base OS. Project Trident has lived on as a Desktop variant of Void Linux. Then of course 2020 happened, and now in 2021, life circumstances and priorities are different.\nSo where are things going from here. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot I want to do with Lumina, There\u0026rsquo;s a few things I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of that I need to finish, and there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of other thing that just haven\u0026rsquo;t been finished and there\u0026rsquo;s a few things that haven\u0026rsquo;t ever gotten started.\nBut before I go into a breakdown of the Future of Lumina let me address one thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve been hounded with the past week.\nWill Lumina be relicensed to the GPL? I gotta be honest, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to get so many questions about this so quickly. Ken has been asked a bunch over the past few years, but the number of times I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked this week has been kinda hilarious.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost as if someone got on the GPL-Bat-Phone and said \u0026ldquo;The BSD guy has stepped back, the Linux guy is in charge now\u0026hellip; GO GO GO.\u0026quot;\nFirst off\u0026hellip; Maintainer != Copyright holder. I can\u0026rsquo;t relicense code I didn\u0026rsquo;t write. Even if I wanted to, I cant. There are 76 contributers to Lumina-Desktop Repo. Each of those would either A) re-write all those submissions. B) have each of those contributers agree to relicense their code or C) turn over claim to the code copyright of their submissions to the project, as happens with contributer agreements that some projects use. Should Lumina have something like that, perhaps. It\u0026rsquo;s probably something that should be done sooner than later, as eventually people can\u0026rsquo;t be reached for a multitude of reasons\u0026hellip; but honestly I\u0026rsquo;ve got to many other things to do within Lumina for me to spend time on that right now.\nThe other question I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked quite a bit is if Lumina will become a 1st part citizen on Linux. In a way it already is. Since Lumina was primarily designed to be OS Agnoistic as long as it\u0026rsquo;s running on a unix-like OS. It\u0026rsquo;s dependencies are very minimal, mostly X.org, Qt and a few other minor libraries. It was never designed to be BSD Only. It honestly super easy to build it on my Slackware box in 2014, and it still is today. My intentions are to keep Lumina as OS Agnostic as Ken designed it to be. Currently Lumina is the default desktop for Project-Trident, and one of these days I may work up a Fedora Spin for Lumina now that I\u0026rsquo;m the maintainer of Fedora-Jam.\nSo enough yammering on, what does the Future roadmap look like. I can break this down into two main catagories, minor changes and major changes.\nThe minor tasks: In the minor camp, there are a bunch of things to make the Desktop work better.\n Make all user icons customizable:  Currently only a few are (User Menu Icon) they all should be able to be reset to whatever the user wants.\n Wallpaper creator:  A simple wallpaper creator to take any image and crop/zoom to make a clean desktop wallpaper based on whatever resolution you want.\n A panel web search widget:  Just a little widget that\u0026rsquo;s a text box where you can enter something and it\u0026rsquo;ll open a browser tab and search for that string. Basically just streamline the multiple steps of opening a browser, going to a search engine, and then searching for whatever.\n Clean up the Font viewer:  One already exists in my personal repo, it never got polished enough to move into Lumina.\n Quick Lumina Text View and Quick Lumina Image Viewer:  These already exist in my personal reapo, but as with the Font viewer, they arent polished enough. The long term plan was to integrate these directly into the file manager, but it needs to be re-written first. (see below)\n Panel widgets improvements:  There are a lot of oddities with the current widgets. This is most likely because they were some of the first things written and havent been messed with since. Some have scaling problems, some only work if the panel is horizonal and go haywire if its vertical. All of these would probably be resolved if it was given a quick once over and designed better. I put this in the minor tasks area, because they\u0026rsquo;re all small individual bits that could be done individualy. We have also needed some new plugins written as well, so that\u0026rsquo;d fall under this as well.\n  Make the current Trident theme the default theme for Lumina.\n  Integrate Icon Theme:\n  The current icon theme we\u0026rsquo;re using in Trident is GPL, so we can\u0026rsquo;t just merge it in as the default. I\u0026rsquo;d like to find a icon designer who would be willing to work with me on a simple icon theme for Lumina as the default. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be many icons, I\u0026rsquo;m guessing maybe 50 total. I only want to cover what\u0026rsquo;s in Lumina/Trident and leave the rest to be filled in by a user as they add their own icon themes.\n Bring lumina-notify back in:  This was a small utility I made a long time ago as a quick drop in replacement for gtknotify that I learned to love when I was a PuppyLinux Dev. I think at some point it ended up getting dropped out of the build and it needs to get brought back in, as the plan was to use it for user notifications.\n Lumina Website:  Not really desktop related, but this needs to be refreshed.\nThe major tasks:  cmake conversion:  Right now there are a bunch of build issues on various Linux OSes because of some weird interaction between using Qmake with the .pro files and building them with make. Qt6 is moving away from qmake and going to cmake, and this will be resolved when that\u0026rsquo;s done.\n Qt6 conversion:  This speaks for itself.\n Lumina-FM:  The file manager needs a re-write to use the qfilesystem class. I know there are bunch of other desktops that have already done this, but since they\u0026rsquo;re GPL, I cant take thier work. Besides the re-write there are a few features that are currently in the file manager that need to be re-implemented and a couple new features to be added.\n Lumina-Config:  I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of re-writing the Lumina-Config utility, that will then enable different configuration options to be directly built into the Panel and the desktop right click menu.\n 2.0 Window Manager:  Ken started working on this and it does technically work. There are issues though. His work needs to be finished. However this may need to finished with the following item in mind.\n Wayland prep:  Wayland is coming\u0026hellip; eventually.\n IFDEFS:  If possible and if and only if it doesnt make the code a nasty mess, I\u0026rsquo;d like to work in ifdefs to resolve downstream issues between BSD/Linux OSes, instead of leaving it up to the OS/Distro devs to patch the sources before building. I\u0026rsquo;d like to get those things fixed upstream to make their life easier.\nFinal Thoughts So that\u0026rsquo;s a quick brain dump of what\u0026rsquo;s in my head at the current moment as far as Lumina. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to help, please reach out, I\u0026rsquo;m easy to track down in all the usual places.\nIn the words of the Tenth Doctor, Allons-y.\n"
